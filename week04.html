<h1>Week 04 – Errors and Usability Issues</h1>

<p>
This week focused on understanding user errors and how interface design can help
prevent or recover from them.
</p>

<p>
Dix et al. classify errors into slips and mistakes, where slips occur during execution
and mistakes occur due to incorrect goals or understanding (Dix et al., Chapter 8).
</p>

<h2>Types of Errors</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Slips – correct intention, wrong action</li>
  <li>Mistakes – incorrect intention or plan</li>
</ul>

<p>
Effective systems provide feedback, clear error messages, and easy recovery mechanisms
to improve overall usability.
