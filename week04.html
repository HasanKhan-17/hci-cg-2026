<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
Week 04 emphasized understanding user errors and how interface design can
prevent or mitigate them.
</p>
<p>
Dix et al. categorize errors as slips (execution errors) and mistakes (planning errors)
(Chapter 8). Effective feedback and recovery mechanisms improve usability.

<li>Slips: unintended actions during task execution</li>
<li>Mistakes: incorrect intentions or goals</li>
<li>Feedback mechanisms for error correction</li>
<li>Designing for recoverability and learnability</li>
</ul>

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>
By analyzing errors, we can identify design flaws and improve system usability.
Providing clear instructions and immediate feedback reduces both slips and mistakes.
