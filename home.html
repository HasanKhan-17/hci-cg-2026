<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
This website has been developed as part of the Human–Computer Interaction (HCI) course
to document weekly learning, theoretical understanding, and practical observations.
The portfolio is structured to present HCI concepts clearly while keeping the original
repository unchanged.

<p>
Human–Computer Interaction is the study of how people interact with computer systems
and how these systems can be designed to support users effectively.
According to Dix et al., HCI focuses on the design, evaluation, and implementation
of interactive systems by considering human capabilities, limitations, and cognitive processes
(Dix et al., Chapter 1).

<p>
This portfolio reflects my understanding of key HCI concepts such as interaction,
human factors, interface design, and interaction models. Each section corresponds
to weekly topics and is grounded in established HCI theory.
