<h1>Week 02 – Humans and Computers</h1>

<p>
This week focused on understanding the human component of interactive systems.
Human abilities and limitations strongly influence how systems should be designed.
</p>

<p>
According to Dix et al., factors such as perception, attention, memory, and motor skills
play a critical role in interaction design (Dix et al., Chapter 2).
</p>

<h2>Key Concepts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Human perception and sensory systems</li>
  <li>Short-term and long-term memory</li>
  <li>Cognitive processing and attention</li>
</ul>

<p>
Designers must account for these factors to reduce cognitive load and ensure
that interfaces align with natural human behavior.
