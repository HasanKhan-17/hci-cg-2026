<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
Week 02 focused on human capabilities and limitations that influence system design.
This includes perception, memory, attention, and motor skills.
</p>
<p>
Dix et al. highlight that understanding these factors allows designers to reduce
cognitive load and create interfaces that align with natural human behavior
(Chapter 2).

<h2>Key Learning Points</h2>
<ul>
<li>Human perception and sensory processing</li>
<li>Memory: short-term, long-term, and working memory</li>
<li>Attention: selective, divided, and sustained</li>
<li>Motor skills and response time considerations</li>
</ul>

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>
Designers must consider human limitations to prevent errors and frustration.
For example, too many simultaneous options may overwhelm short-term memory,
while poorly labeled buttons can confuse perception.
