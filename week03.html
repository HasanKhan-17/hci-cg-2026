<h1>Week 03 – Interaction and Interface Design</h1>

<p>
This week examined how users interact with systems through different interaction styles.
Interaction styles define the communication between users and computers.
</p>

<p>
Dix et al. identify several common interaction styles, each with its own advantages
and limitations depending on the context of use (Dix et al., Chapter 4).
</p>

<h2>Interaction Styles</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Command-line interaction</li>
  <li>Menu-based systems</li>
  <li>Form-based interaction</li>
  <li>Direct manipulation interfaces</li>
</ul>

<p>
Choosing an appropriate interaction style is essential for usability and depends
on user expertise and task complexity.
