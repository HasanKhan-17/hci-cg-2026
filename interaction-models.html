<h1>Interaction Models</h1>

<p>
Interaction models provide a framework for understanding how users interact with
computer systems. These models help designers predict user behavior and evaluate
interface efficiency.

<h2>Norman’s Model of Interaction</h2>

<p>
Norman’s model describes interaction as a cycle consisting of goal formation,
execution, and evaluation. Dix et al. explain that the gulfs of execution and
evaluation represent mismatches between user intentions and system responses
(Dix et al., Chapter 7).
</p>

<h2>GOMS Model</h2>

<p>
The GOMS model (Goals, Operators, Methods, and Selection rules) is a predictive model
used to analyze expert user behavior. It breaks tasks into structured components
to estimate performance (Dix et al., Chapter 8).
</p>

<h2>Keystroke-Level Model (KLM)</h2>

<p>
The Keystroke-Level Model estimates the time required to perform tasks by analyzing
low-level actions such as keystrokes, pointing, and mental preparation
(Dix et al., Chapter 8).
</p>

<h2>Importance of Interaction Models</h2>

<p>
Interaction models support usability evaluation and guide interface design decisions
by identifying inefficiencies and potential usability problems before implementation.
