<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
Interaction models allow designers to predict user behavior and evaluate interface efficiency.
They provide structured frameworks for analyzing tasks and system feedback.

<h2>Norman’s Model of Interaction</h2>
<p>
Norman describes interaction as a cycle of goal formation, execution, and evaluation.
The gulfs of execution and evaluation show the gaps between user intentions and system
responses (Dix et al., Chapter 7).
</p>
<p>Example: Clicking a "Submit" button and receiving confirmation illustrates execution and evaluation steps.</p>

<h2>GOMS Model</h2>
<p>
GOMS (Goals, Operators, Methods, Selection rules) predicts expert user performance
by breaking tasks into measurable components (Dix et al., Chapter 8).
</p>
<p>Example: Filling a form using a consistent sequence of keystrokes demonstrates GOMS application.</p>

<h2>Keystroke-Level Model (KLM)</h2>
<p>
KLM estimates task completion time based on low-level actions like keystrokes,
pointing, and mental preparation (Dix et al., Chapter 8).
</p>
<p>Example: Calculating the time for copying text from one field to another using KLM operators.</p>

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>
Using interaction models, designers can identify inefficiencies and design
interfaces that reduce errors and cognitive load, improving overall usability.
